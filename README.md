# Taiyo Company Frontend Project

Welcome to the Taiyo Company Project! This project showcases a basic UI with two main features: Contact Management and Charts & Maps.

# Contact
The Contact feature allows you to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing contacts. You can add new contacts, edit existing ones, and delete contacts as needed. If there are no contacts added, an information box will be displayed to provide feedback to the user.

## Features
- Add new contacts
- Edit existing contacts
